    <h2 class="shadow1">What is Life Coaching?</h2>
    <h5  class="shadow2">Short answer: the best decision you'll ever make.</h5>
    <p  class="black">
      Life coaching is a present and future focused process that increases self awareness, accomplishes goals,
      prioritizes your values, and doubles down on your strengths. Our relationship will be collaborative and evolving.
      Instead of bringing you from negative to zero, life coaching brings you from zero to infinity. Let us help you
      bridge the gap between where you are now and where you'd like to be.</p>
